                    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
                    <p>We do not collect any personal information.</p>

                    <h2>Cookies</h2>
                    <p>We use Google Analytics cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.
                        Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard
                        drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers
                        systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>

                    <h2>Third-Party Advertising</h2>
                    <p>Some of the advertisements you see on the Site are selected and delivered by third parties, such
                        as ad networks, advertising agencies, advertisers, and audience segment providers. These third
                        parties may collect information about you and your online activities, either on the Site or on
                        other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies in an effort to understand
                        your interests and deliver to you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. The
                        information practices of these third parties are not covered by this privacy policy.</p>

                    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
                    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
                        information (and we do not collect such information). This does not include trusted third
                        parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so
                        long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your
                        information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site
                        policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally
                        identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or
                        other uses.</p>

                    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our
                        website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore
